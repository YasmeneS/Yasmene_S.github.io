         <p>Prep time</p>
         <hr>
         <h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
         <p>2 1/2 cups warm water</p>
         <p>Mozzarella and ricotta cheese</p>
         <p>Tomato sauce</p>
         <p>Olive oil</p>
         <p>2 tsp active dry yeast</p>
         <p> 7 cups all-purpose flour</p>
         <p>1 tsp sugar</p>
         <p>1 1/2 tsp salt</p>
         <p>Basil</p>
         <p>Dried oregano</p>
         <hr>
         <h3>Directions</h3>
         1. Make the yeast rise by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
         <p>2.In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
        </p>
        <p>3. Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft and smooth. Form the dough into a circle.</p>
        <p>4. Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</p>
        <p>5. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</p>
        <p>6. Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</p>
        <p>7. Preheat oven to 450-500 degrees fahrenheit. Put baking sheet or skillit in oven.</p>
        <p>8. Stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.</p>
        <p>9. Sprinkle flour onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</p>
        <p>10. Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown. </p>
